If you do not wish to fiddle with [[Installing from Source on Device |setting Termux up from source code]] from scratch, download and install Termux from F-Droid. Do so by following these instructions: 


# Open F-Droid on your Android or Chrome OS device by tapping [https://f-droid.org/repository/browse/?fdid=com.termux this link], 
# Tap Download APK, 
# Tap the downloaded APK on your device, 
# Tap allow installation of apps from unknown sources (you will want to set this option anyway to be able to install [[Working_with_APKs |apps built on your device]] in Termux), 
# Allow the installation to complete, 
# Once installed, you will see the Termux launcher on your home screen and in your App Drawer. Tap the icon to fire up the application.


Please do not mix your installation of Termux between Google Play and F-Droid. There are compatibility issues such as, "[https://github.com/termux/termux-api/issues/53 Can't install Termux:Api from google play on Nougat #53]".
