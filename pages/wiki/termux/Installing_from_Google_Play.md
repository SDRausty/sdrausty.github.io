If you do not wish to fiddle with [[Installing from Source on Device |setting Termux up from source code]] from scratch, download and install Termux from Google. Do so by following these instructions: 


# Login to your Google account, if you are not already logged in, 
# Open Google Play Store on your Android device by tapping [https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.termux this link],
# Tap Install, 
# Allow the installation to complete, 
# Once installed, you will see the Termux launcher on your home screen and in your App Drawer. Tap the icon to fire up the application.


Please do not mix your installation of Termux between Google Play and F-Droid. There are compatibility issues such as, "[https://github.com/termux/termux-api/issues/53 Can't install Termux:Api from google play on Nougat #53]".
