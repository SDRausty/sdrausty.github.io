PRoot is a user-space implementation of <code>chroot</code>, <code>mount --bind</code>, and <code>binfmt_misc</code>. This means that users don't need any privileges or setup to do things like using an arbitrary directory as the new root filesystem.


The benefits of enabling PRoot include running Linux operating systems in a Termux [https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chroot chroot] on an Android smartphone and tablet, and Chromebook. Termux offers Linux operating system software for your device in the following flavors:


# [[Arch]]
# [[Archstrike]]
# [[Blackarch]]
# [[Debian]]
# [[Fedora]]
# [[Kali Nethunter]]
# [[Slackware]]
# [[Ubuntu]]


This list of operating systems that run in Termux is not all inclusive. Please add Linux distributions to this list if you have tested them. Also, if you can add or improve any of the installation scripts, the community will be very grateful.

= Settings =
To be used if <code>[[termux-exec]]</code> and <code>proot</code> are installed:
   unset LD_PRELOAD
   export LD_PRELOAD=$PREFIX/lib/libtermux-exec.so
Further explanation when, how and where to use these settings should be added!
