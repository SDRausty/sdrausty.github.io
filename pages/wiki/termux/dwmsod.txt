After an enormous file is created on the external SD card, it is formatted as a [native Android filesystem]( https://www.google.com/search?q=what+is+the+android+file+system). Then it is **mounted** as a native filespace **in $HOME as** the **nonroot** Termux single user using [`mount loopback device`](https://www.google.com/search?q=mount+loopback+device) or similar.

This issue is fairly simple in Linux: **create file of a specific GB size > format filesystem in file > mount filesystem in file via loop device nonroot**. This sequence is impossible today on external micro SD storage in Termux on Android. You might even be mounting a filesystem from a file via loop device nonroot on a notebook or desktop without knowing it when you mount a USB stick, CD, DVD or similar.

Creating and utilizing an enormous native Android filesystem on the external SD card should be doable in some `chroot` or `proot` fashion, possibly even without using `chroot` or `proot`. What is your opinion?

Even though this is a fairly simple issue in Linux **(create file > format filesystem in file > mount filesystem in file via loop device)**, it is impossible in Termux at present.ï»¿

This has been added here to clarify root and nonroot mounts. Linux Deploy https://github.com/meefik/linuxdeploy mounts a beautiful filesystem after downloading on device...

What about "Debian Noroot"? Does this app have the code we are seeking? It appears to mount an image from a file. "The scripts for creating Debian images are located in directory "img" https://github.com/pelya/debian-noroot/tree/master/img "To prepare image, run these scripts:" from https://github.com/pelya/debian-noroot/blob/master/README.md

"Run Debian on top of Android with a single click. No root required! Should work on any high-end device! Unleash full unrestricted desktop environment onto your mobile device! Instant frustration guaranteed! (unless you're using mouse or stylus) [and keyboard]."

```
git clone https://github.com/pelya/debian-noroot
cd debian-noroot
git submodule init
git submodule update //doesn't work, requires passphrase!?
ack loop
ack mount 
ack device
ack img

**Disclaimer:** I usually only use Termux in Android, the APKs and the other goodies built on device (a smartphone). Please see https://sdrausty.github.io/buildAPKs/reallyEasilyBuildAndroidAPKsOnDevice **This issue was last reedited 20170803 UTC for clarity of topic.**
