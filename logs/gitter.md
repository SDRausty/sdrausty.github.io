Condor Is there any way to uniquely identify Termux through e.g. environment variable, or values in a file?
Condor Without user interaction, that is. The environment identification should ideally happen all inside a bash script.

IRC/Gitter bot 17:23
van777 Condor: echo $SHELL ?
Condor That variable only returns a value if I enter an interactive bash shell..
Condor I'm creating a script that uses the sh shell. Still have to figure out a way to distinguish between /bin/sh and /system/bin/sh interpreters for desktop Linux and Android respectively though.
Condor Worst case I'll probably just identify Android that way, but it doesn't seem very professional to use that :/

delt would it be possible to implement a 'sudo' command by using 'su' on rooted devices?
delt im asking because 'su -c' has limitations with special characters / quoting of arguments
delt ie. argument to su's -c option must consist of a single arg, and there's no way to escape special chars or tell the command (or shell) what is what
delt (for example: filenames with spaces)
live_the_dream delt not really

IRC/Gitter bot Nov 03 04:18

live_the_dream yeah. you have sudo command store commands on sdcard then execute commads one you have root
delt live_the_dream: so 'sudo' would need to be implemented at the 'rooting' stage or the 'install your favourite ROM' stage
live_the_dream but that is literally the first thought
live_the_dream i had
delt so use a temp file on a (reliable, always mounted) filesystem that is r/w by termux user
live_the_dream yeah
delt clever, but not at all efficient =)

Bryan Goldstein Nov 03 18:29
@sdrausty have you built the termux Android app using termux?

Fredrik Fornwall Nov 03 20:25
I just pushed an update to the termux-packages repository that should make it easier to build packages maintained out-of-tree. That is, when the package recipe folder (containing build.sh and eventual patches and helper files) is outside of the termux-packages repository itself.
To build an in-tree package, the command
./build-package.sh package-name
is used. This uses the package recipe folder ./packages/package-name/.
To build an out-of-tree package, just specify the path to the folder containing the recipe:
./build-package.sh path/to/my/package
Things should now work without issues (if they don't - report it), including dependency checks so that dependencies gets built first.

Fredrik Fornwall Nov 03 20:31
Dependencies to build are picked up both from the main termux-packages repo, but also from package recipe folder adjacent to the one being built. So, if you are building with
./build-package.sh path/to/my-custom-packages/pkg1
and pkg1 depends on pkg2, which is located at path/to/my-custom-packages/pkg2, the build will first build pkg2 as a dependency.
this should make it easier to maintain packages outside the main repo
an early user of this will be https://github.com/termux/termux-root-packages - a new repo to contain root-only packages

Fredrik Fornwall Nov 03 20:37
as I'm not a root user myself, I would appreciate any help in maintaining termux-root-packages - both the source code repo and if possible also hosting the apt repo

Henrik Grimler 16:14
There is a entry in the wiki about backup and restore: https://wiki.termux.com/wiki/Package_Management#Backup_and_restore_packages
@Auxilus no, the docker image uses ubuntu' s packages and cross compiles the packages. This will always differ from the environment on your device and therefore a build on your device can't guarantee that building
In the docker image will succeed

Henrik Grimler 16:20
Basically: cross compiling a package differs from just compiling it since the build environment has to be carefully setup, and not all packages are configured to deal with this nicely

R34lM4n Hello. There's termux for android kitkat?

IRC/Gitter bot 00:40
R34lM4n Por que no lo hiceron para android 4.4?

IRC/Gitter bot 00:52
rods-tab3 termux requires android >= 5; try gnuroot

Hello. Is it possible to use Termux with Xserver XSDL or a similar x server app for Android?

IRC/Gitter bot 03:15
live_the_dream it is possible

bitcoinmeetups.org 03:30
Cool. Any links to instructions? And does it work well?

IRC/Gitter bot 05:00
pdo_fn14 No debfoster ported to termux guys?

Gustavo Chaín 07:33
hey there
would it be possible to run docker inside and android device?

Henrik Grimler 07:52
@gchaincl there has been much discussion about that and the answer seems to be: no

Gustavo Chaín 08:06
@Grimler91 thanks

Auxilus 09:34
@Grimler91 but I think we can test the build scripts in termux by modifying build-package.sh right?

@fornwall I'm very new to meson. I tried termux_setup_meson but the has_function function doesn't use CFLAGS, LDFLAGS, etc. Is there a way to get around this?

is there an extra step when you build termux-app app to get the environment installed?
actually that is a stupid question, it worked fine before I started changing things

Bryan Goldstein 12:09
I changed com.termux to com.vrmux so I could work on a VR version of termux without a name conflict, and everything works except it can't find "/data/data/com.vrmux/files/usr/bin/login"
1) Is there something I forgot to change to com.vrmux.
2) Is there an easier way I could have gone about this.

@kabbi did most of the work, I'm just trying to bring it up to date

Bryan Goldstein 12:24
@sdrausty - I tried TermuxArch and it puts me in a shell without an editor, I would attempt to edit my pacman sources and locale, but I don't have vi or nano

Sofia 12:35
@brysgo pacman -Syu nano

Bryan Goldstein 12:56
so after setting my mirror using cat
I'm getting errors trying to install packages
so and so -x86_64 does not have a valid architecture
thanks @Soph1a7 - I still can't get anything installed

Bryan Goldstein 13:07
I one thing is saying x86_64 and another is telling it i686
uname -m says i686
but pacman is looking for x86_64

shail0072 13:27
Need penetrating tools for termux where to download?
Like all Kali Linux tools

Bryan Goldstein 13:49
@sdrausty - answer to downloads folder on chromebook pixel 2 is ~/downloads/

Auxilus 14:46
@shail0072 we have metasploit-framework , hydra , nmap , sqlmap

shail0072 14:52
Bbqsql ?
@Auxilus what about other Kali tools?

S D Rausty 14:54
@brysgo vi is built into busybox and works in Termux out-of-the-box . Ditto for vi and nano in Arch.
@brysgo Try the newest version of
https://sdrausty.github.io/TermuxArch/
It should detect your system correctly.
If it doesn't, let me know please.

Bryan Goldstein 14:56
Thanks, I'll test it out tonight

S D Rausty 14:57
There have been quite a few changes, including the addition of i686 detection.

Vens Hello. I want to know, does uninstalling termux remove all installed pkgs and files that were installed/created from within termux?

Bryan Goldstein 16:06
While I can't guarantee it, from a user experience perspective it does
@vens

IRC/Gitter bot 16:07
Vens Thank you  another one, is there a way I can list all my currently installed pkgs? I tried 'apt list' that only showed me all available packages though.

Henrik Grimler 16:10
Vens

Bryan Goldstein 16:11
apt list --installed
I think

IRC/Gitter bot 16:13
Vens gitter: thanks for the help. It worked

Henrik Grimler 16:14
There is a entry in the wiki about backup and restore: https://wiki.termux.com/wiki/Package_Management#Backup_and_restore_packages
@Auxilus no, the docker image uses ubuntu' s packages and cross compiles the packages. This will always differ from the environment on your device and therefore a build on your device can't guarantee that building
In the docker image will succeed

Henrik Grimler 16:20
Basically: cross compiling a package differs from just compiling it since the build environment has to be carefully setup, and not all packages are configured to deal with this nicely

Fredrik Fornwall 16:55
@vishalbiswas I'm new to meson myself as well . sounds strange about `has_function´, I guess #mesonbuild on freenode is a good place to ask about it

S D Rausty 17:16
@Grimler91 I would like to setup a build environment on device like for buildAPKs.
Something simple that downloads source, complies it for the specific device, then installs on specific device. No cross-compiling involved.
I have tried https://github.com/termux/termux-packages/tree/master/scripts with some success.
Any suggestions how to make this simple and sweet are appreciated. (download source>build it>installed)

S D Rausty 18:25
Installing from source on device might yield a tremendous increase in program execution speed on device, since it would be compiled for a specific architecture model.
I encountered this tremendous speed increase when compiling kernels per device.
If you are using Linux on a computer, you want to make your own kernel. When you do, you might be amazed that you morphed your machine into the machine that you wanted to buy because you thought it was faster and better.

S D Rausty 18:33
Once you have gotten used to making kernels, it becomes second nature

S D Rausty 18:42
How can I root my device from within Termux? Any GitHub leads are welcome 🌡
