Auxilus Oct 31 08:08
10 is like impossible here

S D Rausty Oct 31 08:08
Scholarships

Go walking
Sleep well #this is very important

Auxilus Oct 31 08:10
I have to walk 2 km to go to college
that's one way trip excluding tutions

S D Rausty Oct 31 08:11
Read the information about food you eat and do not eat it if you don't understand it.
Walking is medicine.

Auxilus Oct 31 08:13
These are the things to do in general or in America?

S D Rausty Oct 31 08:13
In general
Always

Auxilus Oct 31 08:13
Ah, okay..

S D Rausty Oct 31 08:13
If possible

Auxilus Oct 31 08:14
Yeah indeed walking is medicine, I experience it everyday

IRC/Gitter bot Oct 31 08:14
frumpylava but probably especially read the food labels in america, because most things you can eat there is sugary poison.

Auxilus Oct 31 08:15
👍
I see you live in Michigan?

S D Rausty Oct 31 08:15
Do not eat processed sugar.

Jay yo everyone. I'm currently having fun with termux-notifications. I also have a Samsung Gear S 2 smartwatch thingy, which displays notifications with np, but just won't show the termux ones
Jay in the watch settings notification display for all apps is enabled though (and I rebooted phone and watch too)
Jay got anybody experience with samsung gear ignoring termux notifications?

luciom hello, thanks to the developers for the excellent terminal emulator. Just a question: I launched nano on a remote server after connecting with ssh but was unable to exit nano because the CTRL key is not emulated. Any solution?

Auxilus 03:25
luciom
Volm down button emulates control key
Anyone tried compiling wine?

IRC/Gitter bot 03:29
luciom gitter, just tried, it seems that volume down button is not emulating CTRL on my ASUS Zenfone...

Auxilus 03:30
Then you have to use keyboard like Hacker's keyboard which will have function keys

luciom ok thanks gitter

I just want it for generating payloads
@fornwall can you please take a look at the error?
@frumpylava you got javac on your box?

Latest version of Termux (F-Droid) installed along with latest version of GoLang, having issues installing packages, any ideas how to resolve?
go get -u golang.org/x/tools/cmd/goimports
package golang.org/x/tools/cmd/goimports: mkdir /data/data.com.termux: permission denied
go get -u github.com/zmb3/gogetdoc
package github.com/zmb3/gogetdoc: mkdir /data/data.com.termux: permission denied

Ashley Nykiel 13:35
The GoLang package from the Termux repo has a version number of 2:1.9.1 when it should just be 1.9.1, also when reinstalling the GoLang package the version number output does not appear correctly either?
golang/stable,now 2:1.9.1 arm [installed]

@sdrausty what's the difference between TermuxArch and TermuxArchPlus since you seem to link the plus variant on the non plus repository

pocketYoda Is there a way to see the latest package additions from the repositories in apt or pkg?

Malahal 16:51
I am trying to use "cs add cscope.out" but fails. strace showed that vim was trying to use "/bin/sh" to exec cscope. Since /bin/sh is not available on termux, is there a way to fix it? "set shell=correctpath" didn't fix it.
Does anyone use cscope inside vim ?

van777 hey. i'd like to support the request of "moc", that i've found googling --> termux/termux-packages#1637.. I listen to online radio with it in ubuntu.. It'd be quite handy to ssh in, turn on/off or change the radio station...
Condor Is there any way to uniquely identify Termux through e.g. environment variable, or values in a file?
Condor Without user interaction, that is. The environment identification should ideally happen all inside a bash script.

IRC/Gitter bot 17:23
van777 Condor: echo $SHELL ?
Condor That variable only returns a value if I enter an interactive bash shell..
Condor I'm creating a script that uses the sh shell. Still have to figure out a way to distinguish between /bin/sh and /system/bin/sh interpreters for desktop Linux and Android respectively though.
Condor Worst case I'll probably just identify Android that way, but it doesn't seem very professional to use that :/

IRC/Gitter bot 17:32
van777 Condor: try asking on #bash
Condor van777: well it is Termux specifically that I'm targeting..

IRC/Gitter bot 17:37
Condor But the different file paths in Android are a total pain to work with.. Not even the system shell or env are in their expected locations.. And I can't work from bash or in my case zsh shell either.
Condor And I really don't want to make two separate scripts for this.
van777 Condor: what about "whoami"?
Condor u0_a76
Condor Can't work with that.
Condor Anyway, doesn't really matter.. I'll figure something out eventually.
Condor Thanks for your help though :)
van777 which sh

IRC/Gitter bot 17:43
van777 this tells the path
van777 ok, good luck :wink:

@Soph1a7 this wants documentation. Major changes coming up with submodules.
what's the difference between TermuxArch and TermuxArchPlus
The commits need refining. Thanks for bringing this to my attention.
Submodules will keep

at almost the same size on first git clone and give it directories for further downloading if desired. See
https://sdrausty.github.io/buildAPKs/ for a working example. Submodules at buildAPKs was inspired by @vishalbiswas eliminating a bloated < 400M initial download.
