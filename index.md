Message to https://github.com/Grimler91 I have trod on the old cobblestone of the capital north of Stockholm. You enticed me to contribute.  Then you with others deleted my hard effort, my work numerous times before I became aware of your destructive actions towards Termux development.  Later you banned my account from Termux.  @Grimler91, You are keeping Termux off Wikipedia and I know why.  You wanna my latex academic literature and my smartphone bitcoins Swedish liaison.  My academic literature is not to be stolen/deleted, by you and your Termuxed deb packages!

Message to https://github.com/fornwall DITTO. Do you like being the stooge?  Too lazy to merge pull requests?  Or is it, no ones rooted, and I cannot get the bitcoins and bounce a Tesla autodrive?

Message to https://github.com/Neo-Oli DITTO without Swedish encouraging me to root my stuff.  Just you and your team encouraging me to root away my Android citadel.  

Message to https://github.com/xeffyr DITTO without Swedish encouraging me to rooting my stuff.  Just you and your tean encouraging me to root away my Android castle.

Did you wanna root my device to getta my BITCOINS, my Tesla autodrive?
@Grimler91 BITTCOINS+literature? You know, latex is elastic.  Read my work through your Termuxed latex *.deb?  I think not @Grimler91. 
Neo-Oli the Swiss banker, can you please confirm?  Or are you and your team hiding in the Alpine Mountains with other people's bitcoins?

You didn't like the timings, did you?  I did not like them at all.  Why is Termux slower?  Degustamos rooted bitcoins?

Listen; https://github.com/sdrausty/sdrausty.github.io/blob/master/audio/alphaV.webm Possibly you shall comprehend.  Possibly. 

You are welcome to reply to my public statement.  As you know, I have been using Termux software since it arrived.  After years of using (coof coof) your open source software (does it compile?) I have a firm opinion about you.  If it doesn't compile, what are you feeding me?  Why are you wasting my time?  To get my autodrive, my bitcoins?  Why doesn't it compile from the source code that you publish?
