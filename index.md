Message to https://github.com/Grimler91 You enticed me to contribute.  Then you deleted my hard effort, my work.  And latter you banned my account from Termux.  You are keeping Termux off Wikipedia and I know why.  You wanna my latex academic literature and my smartphone bitcoins Swedish liaison.  My academic literature is not to be stolen/deleted, by you and your Termuxed deb packages.

Did you wanna root my device to getta my BITCOINS, my Tesla autodrive?
@Grimler91 BITTCOINS+literature? You know, latex is elastic.  Read my work through your Termuxed latex *.deb?  I think not @Grimler91. 
Neo-Oli the Swiss banker, can you please confirm?  Or are you hiding in the Alpine Mountains with others bitcoins?

You didn't like the timings, did you?  I did not like them at all.  Why is Termux slower?  Degustamos rooted bitcoins?
